This project originated from my thesis, which involved the collection of millions of photos from 26 cities. The objective was to utilize deep learning techniques to conduct scene recognition on these images. By categorizing the data and plotting the seven critical perceptions, the resulting perceptional maps provide insights into how inhabitants perceive their living environment within each city.

Both figures show the average daily population flow distribution among more than 2,000 county-level units. The picture on the left is the average for workdays, and the picture on the right reflects the weekend situation. The former has a “diamond structure” dominated by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Mid-Delta metropolitan areas. The density of the latter reflects the strength of travel in various regions.

Using the perceptional map as a foundation, along with additional geo information such as points of interest (POI) and mobility data, I developed a web application that enables tourists or night runners to select various pedestrian routes within the city. Furthermore, I leveraged the vast dataset of over 100,000,000 photos to calculate safety scores for the entire country. These scores were subsequently sold to Daimler Innovative Lab the following year, providing them with valuable insights and information for their initiatives.
