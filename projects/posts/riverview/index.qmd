To preserve the natural landscapes along the Qiantang River, I analyzed a 200-kilometer stretch of riverbank videos. By carefully examining the footage, I calculated the visual proportions of seven distinct elements present throughout the entire shoreline. Subsequently, I developed a visualization platform that identifies and maps these elements along the riverbank. This platform is a valuable tool in safeguarding the natural beauty and ecological integrity of the Qiantang River, enabling effective management and conservation efforts.
