I am a Ph.D. candidate at [MIT](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/liu-liu) in Computational Urban Science, working at the [City Form Lab](https://cityform.mit.edu/). My research is inherently interdisciplinary, grounded in six years of design education and over five years of professional practice at China’s top urban planning institute, together with advanced training in computer vision, GIS, statistical learning, and multimodal LLMs. I study how built environments shape human behavior through spatial and computational lenses, and I have worked on frontier LLM research as a Ph.D. Applied Scientist Intern with the Amazon AGI Foundation. My projects span visual urban analysis, pedestrian mobility modeling, and perception studies, resulting in peer-reviewed publications and patents.

Alongside academic research, I founded and led [CitoryTech Co LTD](https://www.citory.tech/), a research-driven startup in urban visual AI and spatiotemporal modeling. Over six years, I led more than 20 projects with clients such as the World Bank, Daimler, and Hong Kong Land, and built collaborations with universities including MIT, Tongji University, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Tsinghua University. These experiences strengthened my skills in team leadership, project management, and productization, and gave me practical insight into translating research into practice. I have also served as an external expert for Tencent and a consultant for the World Bank, bridging academic, industry, and policy domains.
