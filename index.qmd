I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Urban Science at MIT](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/liu-liu), working at the [City Form Lab](https://cityform.mit.edu/). My research investigates how built environments influence human behavior through spatial and computational perspectives, integrating computer vision, GIS, and multimodal learning (LLMs, VLMs, and beyond). My work spans visual urban analysis, pedestrian mobility modeling, and perception studies, and includes collaborations with the Amazon AGI Foundation, where I served as a Ph.D. Applied Scientist Intern.

Before joining MIT, I founded [CitoryTech Co LTD](https://www.citory.tech/), a startup specializing in urban visual AI and spatiotemporal modeling. I led over 20 projects with clients such as the World Bank, Daimler, and Hong Kong Land, and collaborated with universities including MIT, Tongji, HKU, and Tsinghua. I have also served as an external expert for Tencent and a consultant for the World Bank.
