I am a Ph.D. Candidate at MIT studying Computational Urban Science. Being a scientist with eight years of entrepreneurship in data-driven urban science research, I continuously focused on the built environment and human behavior analysis by adopting computer vision. 

Before returning to MIT, I was a data scientist at the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, an external expert at Tencent, an STC at the World Bank, and started a company named CitoryTech. 

My academic interests lie in the interdisciplinary fields of AI, machine learning, optimization, urban computing, and urban design research.
