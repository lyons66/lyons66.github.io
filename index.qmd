I am a Ph.D. Candidate at MIT studying Computational Urban Science. Being a scientist with eight years of entrepreneurship in data-driven urban analytics and six years of design training, I focused on the built environment and human behavior analysis by adopting computer vision. 

Before returning to MIT, I am the founder of CitoryTech Co LTD., a start-up in urban computation specializing in urban visual AI. Besides, I was an external expert for Tencent, a consultant for the World Bank, and an urban researcher at the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design.

My academic interests lie in the interdisciplinary fields of AI, machine learning, optimization, and urban design research.
