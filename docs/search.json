    "text": "I am a Ph.D. Candidate at MIT studying Computational Urban Science. Being a scientist with eight years of entrepreneurship in data-driven urban science research, I continuously focused on the built environment and human behavior analysis by adopting computer vision.\nBefore returning to MIT, I was a data scientist at the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design, an external expert at Tencent, an STC at the World Bank, and started a company named CitoryTech.\nMy academic interests lie in the interdisciplinary fields of AI, machine learning, optimization, urban computing, and urban design research."

The objective was to utilize deep learning techniques to conduct scene recognition on these images. By categorizing the data and plotting the seven critical perceptions, the resulting perceptional maps provide insights into how inhabitants perceive their living environment within each city."

The picture on the left is the average for workdays, and the picture on the right reflects the weekend situation. The former has a “diamond structure” dominated by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Mid-Delta metropolitan areas. The density of the latter reflects the strength of travel in various regions."

Furthermore, I leveraged the vast dataset of over 100,000,000 photos to calculate safety scores for the entire country. These scores were subsequently sold to Daimler Innovative Lab the following year, providing them with valuable insights and information for their initiatives."

Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
