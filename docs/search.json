    "text": "Using the perceptional map as a foundation, along with additional geo information such as points of interest (POI) and mobility data, I developed a web application that enables tourists or night runners to select various pedestrian routes within the city. Furthermore, I leveraged the vast dataset of over 100,000,000 photos to calculate safety scores for the entire country. These scores were subsequently sold to Daimler Innovative Lab the following year, providing them with valuable insights and information for their initiatives."

By leveraging a dataset consisting of 300,000 points of interest (POI) from Dianping and office and residential POI data from Anjuke, the project assigns weights to these locations based on their respective scores. These scores indicate the areas with the highest spatial composition within the city. Typically, these dynamic places are considered the most vibrant and active within the urban landscape, reflecting a high degree of functional compounding."

    "text": "The condition of transportation assets can be effectively observed through user-generated content (UGC) images. Analyzing geo-tagged images makes it possible to link the condition reflected in the images to specific geographic locations. This approach has been employed for various transportation assets such as catch basins, guardrails, manholes, road curbs, road markings, road signs, roadways, and sidewalks. By associating these images with corresponding road segments, a comprehensive understanding of the condition of these assets can be generated. This enables better asset management and maintenance strategies, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient transportation systems."

By carefully examining the footage, I calculated the visual proportions of seven distinct elements present throughout the entire shoreline. Subsequently, I developed a visualization platform that identifies and maps these elements along the riverbank. This platform is a valuable tool in safeguarding the natural beauty and ecological integrity of the Qiantang River, enabling effective management and conservation efforts."
