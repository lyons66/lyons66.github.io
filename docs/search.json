It can automatically extract the current scene’s geometric structure and professional characteristics and give improvement tips for composition. A live demo was recorded on 2020 Apr 30 in Shanghai with Huawei Mate 30.\nThis project was terminated during the decrease of tourism in 2020. It’s an independent project and the business plan can be viewed here. To obtain the password to view the BP, please contact me.\n\n\n\nThe Idea\n\nThe foundational idea behind developing this tool is to “help beginners transform into photography experts.” Based on the scene in view, it automatically offers users specific photography suggestions and provides “photography composition guidelines.”\n\n\n\nFunction 1: Composition Recognization\n\nThe tool analyzes the current camera frame, identifies the composition structure, and recommends suitable composition schemes. It can automatically identify 12 major categories and 34 subcategories of compositional benchmarks.\n\n\nThere are two ways of giving users hints about the composition. First, we plot the guidelines on the pictures directly:\n\n\n\nSecond, we provide typical photos with similar compositions:\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction 2: Suggestions based on Scenes\n\nIn addition to this, it can also recognize shooting scenes from 26 major categories and over 100 subcategories. For example, it can identify the current shooting scene and subject, then propose photography suggestions for optimizing the photo. By recognizing the content of the day’s photography subject, it can analyze and understand the content of the subject being shot. Furthermore, it can identify the current pose structure (standing, sitting, etc.) of the person being photographed.\n\n\n\n\nDemo Video\n\nBelow is a demo video we recorded based on Huawei Mate 30 in April, 2020."

    "text": "PROJECT BRIEF\n\n\n\nBoth figures show the average daily population flow distribution among more than 2,000 county-level units. The picture on the left is the average for workdays, and the picture on the right reflects the weekend situation. The former has a “diamond structure” dominated by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Mid-Delta metropolitan areas. The density of the latter reflects the strength of travel in various regions.\n\nHongMou Zhang, Liu Liu, Pensen Wang, Jinhua Zhao, “Depicting the Blurred Regional Boundaries in China Using Individual Mobility Data”\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea\n\nAccording to the closeness of the connection, more than 2,000 county-level units are drawn into a pattern with a gravity layout. Through community detection, about 20 clusters are highlighted, and many share typical degrees of development. For example, most provincial capital cities belong to a single-center model, while the Yangtze and Pearl River Delta metropolitan areas present a network structure.\nThe Following Articles are translated from Chinese versions: City Clusters and City Flows.\n\n\n\nData Source\n\nTencent’s big data research has achieved the highest level in national-scale spatial research, with 600 million monthly active users. They conducted extensive research using large-scale sampling over a wide range of time and space. Utilizing the Tencent Cloud team’s data foundation and technical expertise, they focused on various topics such as migration patterns from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, travel analysis during the Spring Festival, tourism trends on National Day, and early urban congestion warnings. To explore more about Tencent LBSN research, follow their official account, “Yi Chu Xing,” or check out the “WeChat-Wallet-City Service-City Heat Map” for area-specific heat maps.\nThis unprecedented collaboration between the two parties involved a customized cooperation plan to align their needs and ensure smooth research development. The study incorporated three types of research data: population distribution in 10-square-kilometer grid units across the country, population flow matrix across 2,242 county-level units, and message flow within the same county-level units. To ensure comprehensive analysis, the research spanned four distinct periods: five working days, weekends, National Day, and Spring Festival. (For clarification, “population” refers to the research subject below.)\n\n\n\nDistribution of National Population\n\nThe number of active Tencent users shows a strong correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.91) with the user count of 1.33 billion people in China’s Sixth Census, based on the division of county-level units.\nAnalyzing the user distribution on a city scale reveals a polarized pattern within Tencent’s system. In major cities with populations of 1 million or even 10 million, according to the Sixth Census, the concentration of Tencent users surpasses the statistical population. Similarly, unit areas with populations below 500,000 also have relatively high numbers of Tencent users. For ease of comparison, the coordinates in the figure are approximately scaled at a 1:2 ratio.\nApart from comparing census data, the 2014 national and provincial resident population statistics can also be utilized for provincial-level comparisons. In most provinces, the proportional relationship between the two datasets remains close to 1:2.\nInterestingly, when mapping the data spatially, provinces and cities with a higher proportion of Tencent users form a distinctive “ring” pattern. We propose a possible explanation for provinces and cities with lower proportions: the underdeveloped regions in the central and western areas, divided by the Hu Huanyong line, may have insufficient sample sizes of sparsely populated users. As a result, the two circled areas in Northeast China and Central China may more accurately reflect population loss. In other words, these areas might have a significant number of registered populations, but a large portion of them have relocated, and based on location point calculations, they are not considered current residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Flows\n\n\n\n\nCity Clusters\n\nThere are numerous definitions of urban agglomeration, and opinions among academics also vary. This article refrains from delving into extensive analysis or explanations. The following map, resembling a “nebula,” disregards the geographical locations of individual units. Instead, units are positioned closer to each other based on the strength of population flow connections, following the gravity model. (Gephi offers various layouts, and this is just one of them.) To ensure clarity, it is more suitable to use the term “urban community” rather than urban agglomeration to describe the research subject. Notably, the most prominent clusters, akin to dazzling stars in the night sky, primarily consist of renowned urban agglomerations and regions, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Chengdu-Chongqing, and more. Provincial capital cities, including Taiyuan, Xi’an, and Changsha lead the secondary star clusters.\n\nThere are also some particular star-like clusters, such as the one in Shandong Province, probably due to the mountain landscape.\n\nWhen projecting the distribution of these nebulae back into spatial positions, a completely different pattern emerges. By counting, we can identify 17 “urban associations.” Overall, these associations exhibit a spatial clustering pattern. However, unlike previous divisions of related urban agglomerations, most of these “urban associations” feature “breaks” or “enclaves.” This outcome is a result of not intentionally considering spatial adjacency constraints during calculations, and it objectively reflects the development imbalances between cities or regions, particularly in terms of population flow strength.\nLet’s take a closer look at the “Yangtze River Delta City Association” as an example. In addition to the conventional analysis that includes southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, it is observed that Xuzhou, Lianyungang, and other cities in northern Jiangsu also have close ties to the association. This reflects the strengthening connection between the southern and northern parts of Jiangsu province, while a certain gap exists in the central area of Jiangsu. Furthermore, within the Yangtze River Delta region, Anhui is identified as another “community” centered around Hefei. This suggests that, based on existing population contact data, Anhui has not yet formed close connections with the developed regions of the Yangtze River Delta. Indeed, many “communities” align with provincial boundaries, adhering to the administrative management system in China. However, there are exceptions to this pattern. For instance, the “Pearl River Delta Urban Associations” extend their influence to Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and other neighboring areas beyond Guangdong Province. Furthermore, cities like Harbin in Heilongjiang, located far away, bypass the “Liaoshen urban community” and establish direct connections with Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. These exceptions highlight the complex dynamics of urban interactions that sometimes transcend administrative boundaries. In addition to utilizing data from working days for division, other time periods can also be employed for the same analysis. For instance, the provided image demonstrates a division based on the National Day period. In addition to employing the community detection model, another approach to analyze connections is through the use of K-Core. This method is generally associated with determining the prominence of a city. The higher the connectivity of a city or region, the higher its K-Core value, indicating its elevated status."

    "text": "PROJECT BRIEF\n\n\n\nThis project originated from my thesis, which involved the collection of millions of photos from 26 cities. The objective was to utilize deep learning techniques to conduct scene recognition on these images. By categorizing the data and plotting the seven critical perceptions, the resulting perceptional maps provide insights into how inhabitants perceive their living environment within each city.\n\nLiu, L., Zhou, B., Zhao, J., & Ryan, B. D. “C-IMAGE: city cognitive mapping through geo-tagged photos” GeoJournal, 81(6), 817-861.\nZhou, B., Liu, L., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. “Recognizing city identity via attribute analysis of geo-tagged images” European conference on computer vision (pp. 519-534).\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea\n\nHalf a century ago, Kevin Lynch’s City Image project provided a collaborative depiction of the “perceived city” by gathering input from the public through a method called “mental mapping.” Now, with the power of computer vision and the ability to leverage crowd-sourced geo-tagged photos, we can explore whether we can detect people’s sentiments towards their physical living environment. By analyzing these images using computer vision algorithms, we aim to gain insights into how individuals feel about their surroundings and further enhance our understanding of urban landscapes.\n\n\n\nData Processing\n\nThe download of the Panoramio geo-tagged images are through Pranoramio data API and Flickr API.\n\n\n\nScene Classification\n\nThe images are classified based on Places 365. For this study, I selected Panoramio and, subsequently, Flickr as the primary sources for data collection. Approximately 30 million photographs were gathered by the completion of the project. The geographical spread of these photos offers a unique perspective, allowing for a comparison with the urban image as conceptualized by Kevin Lynch, which was derived from a multitude of cognitive maps.\n\n\n\nMapping the Perceptions\n\nAfter being processed through scene recognition, currently called Places365, the photos were categorized into 102 attributes. I subsequently conducted a reclassification, streamlining the images to form a generalized portrayal of the city’s public image. This led to retaining only those scenes that are associated with public spaces.\nBy retaining only seven critical perceptions and plotting them on city maps, we can observe varying city patterns that truly reflect what the inhabitants “see.” This approach allows for fascinating discoveries that can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, a comparison can be made between the perception of green spaces in Shanghai and Tokyo.\n\n\n\nOther Cases\n\nThis method is highly replicable and has been employed in various real-world projects following a relatively fixed procedure. Additionally, the critical perceptions can be broken down into more specific categories. For instance, I divided the green perception into seven sub-elements, which led to discoveries.\n\n\n\nDemo Video\n\nBelow is a demo video showing the distribution of image classification results in Shenzhen."

    "text": "PROJECT BRIEF\n\n\n\nTo preserve the natural landscapes along the Qiantang River, I analyzed a 200-kilometer stretch of riverbank videos. By carefully examining the footage, I calculated the visual proportions of seven distinct elements present throughout the entire shoreline. Subsequently, I developed a visualization platform that identifies and maps these elements along the riverbank. This platform is a valuable tool in safeguarding the natural beauty and ecological integrity of the Qiantang River, enabling effective management and conservation efforts.\nThis work has been re-presented in Rez de Ville / Urban Ground Floors 2023.\n\n\n\nThe Idea\n\nThis project aims to protect the historical and cultural features of the Qiantang River and the upstream Fuchun River and Xin’an River, covering a more than 200-kilometer waterfront. The famous Fuchun Mountain Habitat map depicts the natural scenery on both sides of the strait, but now it has been damaged by the excessive development of many residential buildings.\n\n\n\nData Process\n\nThe project is conducted based on the video along the Qiantang River, where over 40000 frames are extracted along the three sections covering the north and south bank.\n\nAfter segmenting the video frames into different segmentations, we could view different landscape prototypes along the river.\n\n\n\nResult Analysis\n\nOne of the major triggers for this project is to identify over-developed real estate. By composing metrics such as building height / plant height, it is easily to locate those banks.\n\nOther methods are also applied for each section of the entire river.\n\n\n\nDemo Video\n\nBelow is a platform we created for verifying the metrics for different waterfront view sections."
